                                        We cooperate with external service providers to fulfil certain contractual obligations. This is the case, for example, in connection with specific supplier and customer management services, hosting of IT infrastructure and external service center, payment processing (bank payment, credit card, direct debiting, account opening), logistics and delivery, promotional activities or the transaction of online orders. As far as we involve external service providers, this always takes place within the legal limits and in compliance with the applicable data protection regulations.

Such transactions typically entail the transfer of customer information pertaining to the sold or divested subsidiary or business part to the buyer or to the company created by the merger. Your personal information continues to be governed by the provisions of this privacy policy in this case. In the unlikely event of a complete sale of BPO7 thereof, your personal information will also be transferred to the buyer.

                                        You have the right to object at any time to certain types of processing of your data for reasons arising from your particular situation. This right applies to data processing in the public interest and to data processing to protect legitimate separate interests. This right also applies to profiling, insofar as it is based on these two provisions.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        In the event of a contradiction, we will cease processing your personal data. However, this does not apply if we can prove compelling reasons worthy of protection for the processing, that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or if the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.

                                        You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data for these purposes. This right also applies to profiling insofar as it is connected to direct marketing.
